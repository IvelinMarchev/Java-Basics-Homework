We should create a temporary folder C:\myexample. 
Then we should copy our file "SumTwoNumbers.java" in the folder above. After that we must
run Command Prompt and type:

C:\> cd \myexample

This makes C:\myexample the current directory.


C:\myexample> dir

This displays the directory content. You should see "SumTwoNumbers.java" among the files.


C:\myexample> set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_20\bin

This tells the system where to find JDK programs.


C:\myexample> javac SumTwoNumbers.java

This runs javac.exe, the compiler. You should see nothing, but the next system prompt.


C:\myexample> dir

javac has created the "SumTwoNumbers.class" file. You should see "SumTwoNumbers.java" and 
"SumTwoNumbers.class" among the files.


C:\myexample> java SumTwoNumbers

This runs the Java interpreter. You should see the program output.It will be blank at fist,
you should type two numbers and their sum will be the output.


If the system cannot find javac, check the set path command.  If the program compiles but
you get an exception, check the spelling and capitalization in the file name and the class
name and the java "SumTwoNumbers" command.
